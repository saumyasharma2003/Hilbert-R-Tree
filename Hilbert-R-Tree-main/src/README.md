# Hilbert-R-Tree

## Group 2

------

## To run the code:

1. Replace the filename variable in main function with the name of file containing the data. 

    - data should be in specified format: x,y coordinates of each point seperated by space, and every point in a seprate line
        - eg 1 2 in first line
    - file should be in same directory

2. Uncomment the commented-out call to PreOrderTraversal or Search in main(), according to your requirements.

3. Change directory to src, and compile the code using 

```
    gcc DSA_assignment_group_2.c
```

4. Run the compiled code using

```
    ./a.out
```
If you want your output in a file, run it using

```
    ./a.out > output.txt
```
